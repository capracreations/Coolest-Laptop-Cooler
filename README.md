## .STL 3D Model Files
![](/images/hexRC.png) 
.stl CAD files for the Hexapod and RF Controller are provided for download, parts are designed and toleranced to be **_3D-printed_**. The Hexapod is composed of two main body parts, and six legs with three segments each. Each leg has three rotational joints to allow for a sufficient range of motion.

## Cooler Code File
For ease of use and to limit confusion please note that the main code is always assigned the **_.ino_** file type. All **_.h_** and **_.cpp_** type files are **_declarations and definitions_** for objects or functions used within the main **_.ino_** code. To be able to use the code in a "plug and play" style, download the entire root file as a .zip and extract to where desired. From there open the main **_.ino_** file within "Arduino Code/Hexapod" as is and it will ask if you want to create and store the **_.ino_** file in a folder of its own name. Select "yes" and transfer the **_.h_** and **_.cpp_** files into the created directory and they should be applied to the main file automatically.
